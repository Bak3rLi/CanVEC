We are working on anonymising and turning the corpus into an interactive tool. In the mean time, if you wish to access the data, please get in touch via this [form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IH0wcAQ7QUWzXNpzwQyVaMzJmmwz82KenpX9SInqaww/viewform?edit_requested=true). An extended sample of continuous dialogue in CanVEC is also available in the text file.
